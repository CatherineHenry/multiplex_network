# Multiplex Model of Mental Lexicon with Visual and Word Embeddings

This project is divided into two phases:

*Phase 1*
- Create a new network layer for word embeddings using GloVe. Compare the new layer with the already existing multiplex network + the visual layer. Analyze the differences in information stored in either network. 

*Phase 2*
- Attach new word nodes to a network with limited amount of words (let's say 200). Explore the attachment and the final result. Compare the final result network with the one generated on the full vocabulary.
